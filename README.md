## Installation

Minify the Kibe script by running the `gulp` task and paste it to the head section of your website as inline JavaScript. Configure it in the same script tag.

## Usage example

Lets suppose you are using an A/B testing framework but you want to have the possibility to develop and test the experiments locally. The reference to the file generated by the A/B testing framework can look like `//abdomain.com/foo.js`. You'll want this script to be loaded for all your users. However, during development you'll want to supress that script and add a reference to a local script, with the new experiment.

With Kibe you can substitute JavaScript references on your website. And this will affect only your active browser.

First you have to configure it

``` js
kibe({
  def: kibe.js('ab', '//abdomain.com/foo.js'),
  dev: kibe.js('ab', 'http://localhost:1155/index.js')
});
```

Now that Kibe is on the page, you can execute `kibe('dev')` in the console of the browser and kibe will enter the dev mode. In dev mode, the localhost reference will be added to the page instead of the abdomain.com reference.
